- Uses [margs](https://github.com/MAIPA01/margs) for parsing command-line arguments.
- Uses [opusfile](https://github.com/xiph/opusfile) as .opus file reader.
- Uses [OpenAL](https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft) for audio api.
- Uses [blue](https://github.com/dotBlueShoes/blue) as my personal standard c/cpp lib.
